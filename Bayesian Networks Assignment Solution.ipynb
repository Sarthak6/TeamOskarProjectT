    "This week in class, we covered Bayesian Networks - probabilistic graph based modelling tools that rely on Bayesian inference for certain probability computations/queries. They aim to model conditional independences and dependences between a set of events (and thus causation) via their structure which is discussed later on. As we saw in class, having. domain knowledge is particularly useful when it comes to modelling Bayes Nets - and that should be clearer by the end of this assignment."

In the case of certain algorithms learnt in class such as those for parameter estimation and structure learning, you will also get first hand experience with how to implement and test out/compare these algorithms against the library version. The reason behind this is that while it is easy (and important) to be able to call the right library functions, it is also important to be able to know what is going on behind the scenes and implement this in case you may need to make minor modifications to well known algorithms (which is quite often the case in research and the industry)."

Essentially, for each variable, you need consider only that column of data and the columns corresponding to that variables parents. If it is a univariate distribution, then the maximum likelihood estimate is just the count of each symbol divided by the number of samples in the data. If it is a multivariate distribution, it ends up being the probability of each symbol in the variable of interest given the combination of symbols in the parents. For example, if you wanted the MLE estimate for P(Smoking = Yes), you would count the total number of rows in your data where smoking was yes and divide that by the total number of rows in your data. Similarly, if you wanted the MLE estimate for P(Dyspnea = No | Bronchitis = Yes), you would count the total number of rows where Dyspnea is No and Bronchitis is Yes and divide that by the number of rows where Bronchitis is Yes."

    "<b>Answer:</b> With k = 0, the probability is 0.9929335756107409. As k increases, the probability of  P(Tuberculosis = No | Asia = No) decreases as the model becomes more and more general and trusts the observed data (which has a lot of observations of Tuberculosis = No | Asia = No) less. In the most general case, when k tends towards infinity, since the domain size of Tuberculosis is 2, P(Tuberculosis = No | Asia = No) will tend towards 1/Domain Size = 0.5. This makes sense and we can see this slowly happening in our curve. Also note the rate of probability decrease is quick first and then slowly reduces. You should be able to use mathematical reasoning to figure out why this is happening. K is a hyperparameter and it requires tuning - a different topic in this course you will end up learning."

You also learnt how to automatically do this in Pomegranate. Lastly, you saw how ML estimates may overfit to data and thus we can use Laplace smoothing to generalise our model. There are various other algorithms for smoothing and parameter estimation such as MAP, the EM algorithm - which you are encouraged to check out but are out of scope for this course."

Now the goal becomes to try to learn the Bayes Net structure. Once we have done this, we can apply techniques learnt in section 1 and 2 to do anything we normally would with a Bayes Net. Thus, we will formulate the problem in this section as Bayes Net Structure Learning, or BNSL for short."

    "There are many algorithms for BSNL and they usually fall under the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Score and Search Based: Keep in mind from our data we will always know the associated states in a Bayes Net. Also, remember that a Bayes Net structure is a DAG. This algorithm searches over the space of all possible (DAGs) and identifies the one that minimizes some objective function. Typical objective functions attempt to balance the log probability of the data given the model (the likelihood). As you may expect, the runtime of this algorithm becomes exponential in the number of variables and thus this algorithm is very unfeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constraint Learning: This typically involves calculating some measure of correlation or co-occurrence to identify an undirected backbone of edges that may exist, and then prune these edges until a DAG is reached. There is no probabilistic interpretation of this type of algrithms so do not spend too much time trying to understand these for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Approximate Algorithms: The key idea here is that we want to make score and search quick while maintaining its accuracy. Approximate algorithms develop heuristics for score and search to quickly find good structures in a reasonable amount of time. This class of algorithms include the Chow Liu algorithm and the hill climbing algorithm you have seen in lecture."

    "\n",
    "1. Chow Liu Trees - Add each possible edge in the DAG with an associated weight (representing the \"quality\" of that edge), and then build a MST using thes weights. Discussed in more detail later on.\n",

    "2. Greedy - This uses the Score and Search with A* whose heuristics are out of scope.\n",

    "3. Exact DP - This uses the Score and Search with Dynamic Programing whose details are out of scope.\n",

    "<b>Question</b>: Look at the graphs outputted. The axes on the first graph should make it pretty clear what it is trying to convey. For the second graph, we have the log of P(D|M) on the y-axis. P(D|M) is a measure of how well the built model explains the data and higher values for P(D|M) mean that the model has done a better job of explaining the data. Using these 2 graphs, compare and contrast the 4 algorithms available in Pomegranate. Note: The purple and cyan lines superimpose on the right plot as they produce the same graphs."

    "<b>Answer</b>: From the graphs we can see that as the number of variables in our Bayes Net increases, the Chow Liu algrithm stays very quick and constantly performs the quickest. This makes sense as it always builds an MST. The greedy A* based algorithm also stays quick but we can see the exact based algorithms blow up in terms of time taken as they consider a pretty large subset of all possible DAG's which increases exponentially with the number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the other plot we can make out in terms of performance the quality of the exact based algorithms becomes better and better than the Greedy and Chow Liu algorithms as they consider many more possible DAG's whose effect is more apparent when there are so many DAG's to consider. \n",

    "In this assignment you learnt a lot about constructing Bayes Net in Python using Pomegranate, using these Bayes Nets for inference, parameter estimation and structure estimation. Along the way, you got experience with how to do these different tasks and you also implemented a few of them yourself from scratch. You should realise by now that libraries such as Pomegranate are pretty useful when it comes to Bayes Nets - this is because Bayes Nets can pretty quickly get large and running inference, likelihood calculations can get arduous very easily. Moreover, just given some data, you are now equipped to first find a structure, then do parameter estimation, and any inference you may need to do. You also worked with real life datasets and Bayes Nets. Here is a more detailed explanation of the learning objectives achieved in each section:"

    "<b>Section 1</b>: This section taught you how Pomegranate can be used to build a Bayes Net whose structure and CPT's you know. You saw how once you have 'baked' your model, you can answer any query you may have by running inference using Pomegranate's well defined and easy to use interface. Furthermore, in this section you got practice in converting a problem description to a Bayes Net with associated CPT's. You then ran inference to understand the dynamics of the Monty Hall problem. At the end of the section, you should have got enough practice on constructing a Bayes Net and knowing how to answer any queries using it. You answered conitional probability, marginal, and joint queries easily using Pomegranate.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Section 2</b>: This section taught you how Pomegranate can be used to estimate the entries of a CPT in a Bayes Net whose structure you know and for which you have been given observed data for each variable in the net. You saw how once you have 'baked' your model with each CPT entry as 0, you can 'fit' to the data you have observed and this will automatically populate the CPT's for you using the ML Parameter estimation procedure. Furthermore, you saw that once this is done you can run inference as normal. In fact, you understood the ML Estimation algorithm and implemented it on your own and saw it performed exactly like the Pomegranate version. Lastly, you learnt about overfitting to observed data and the problem of zero- and to solve this you understood Laplace smoothing and added this functionality to your custom built ML Parameter Estimation algorithm. Overall, you got a good grasp of implementing and understanding parameter observation having observed some data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Section 3</b>: This section taught you how Pomegranate can be used to estimate the structure itself of  Bayes Net for which you have been given observed data for each variable in the net. You saw how there are various algorithms that can help us out with this process and you compared and contrasted the four algorithms that Pomegranate implements for this purpose - understanding the tradeoff between speed and 'goodness'. We looked at the Chow Liu Tree algorithm in detail and you succcessfully implemented this from scratch and saw it gave you results similar to the Pomegranate version. All in all, at the end of this section you were well aware of how to go from just observed data to finding a structure (assuming no prior domain knowledge), to finding parameters, to running vanilla inference."

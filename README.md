# Bayesian Networks

Code written by Naveen Durvasula, Haydn Gwyn, Oskar Hurst, and Sarthak Arora.

Over the course of this tutorial, we hope that everyone will have a sufficient understanding of these topics.
- Understands what a probability distribution is and how to condition event as well as manipulate Bayes Law
- Can describe the structure and components of a Bayes Nets and the relationship between parent and children nodes.
- Is able to use a trained Bayes Net to perform inference on multiple types of data samples.
- Using a complete dataset can train, and perform parameter learning to complete a Bayes Net.
- Understands and can implement the chow-liu algorithm for structure learning of a Bayes Net.
- Student will be proficient in using the python package pomegranate to manipulate Bayes Nets.

The notes, slides, and the course quiz with answers are available as pdfs within this repository.

Our Jupyter assignment allows students hands-on experience creating Bayes Net structures and algorithms from scratch.
As well as, experience with industry-standard Bayes Net python package Pomegranate.

Students will be assigned to fill in missing code, write algorithms from scratch, as well as, make observations on the outputs of the code.

There are two versions of our coding assignment, one which is completed and another for studentsâ€™ use.

The jupyter note book coding assignment require the following packages downloaded.
- numpy
- pandas
- pomegranate
- pygraphviz
- graphviz
- time
- networkx
- sklearn

# Bayesian Networks

## Overview

This repository contains all the materials required for the Week 5 topic of EECS 16ML: Bayesian Networks.

All code and materials have been written by Naveen Durvasula, Haydn Gwyn, Oskar Hurst, and Sarthak Arora.

Over the course of this tutorial, we hope that everyone will have a sufficient understanding of these topics.
- Understands what a probability distribution is and how to condition event as well as manipulate Bayes Law
- Can describe the structure and components of a Bayes Nets and the relationship between parent and children nodes.
- Is able to use a trained Bayes Net to perform inference on multiple types of data samples.
- Using a complete dataset can train, and perform parameter learning to complete a Bayes Net.
- Understands and can implement the chow-liu algorithm for structure learning of a Bayes Net.
- Student will be proficient in using the python package pomegranate to manipulate Bayes Nets.

There is a much detailed explanation of the Learning Objectives achieved in the Bayesian Networks Assignment Jupyter Notebook.

The lecture note, slides, and the course quiz with answers are available as pdfs within this repository. Each of these along with the coding assignments are explained in more detail below.

## Lecture Note

This is simply titled Lecture Note.pdf and can be found in the Lecture Note folder. It gives students all the background necessary to understand the lecture and assignment material. Ideally, it should be released before lecture and should serve as another way to learn all the lecture material in addition to watching lecture.

## Lecture Slides

These are slides explaining the material and can be used in lecture. A Latex Version and a more 'colourful' Non Latex Version can both be found in the Lecture Slides folder.

## Quiz 

A Bayes Net Quiz PDF can be found in the Quiz folder. This PDF contains Quiz questions studens can be asked and they should be able to answer if they have watched the lecture and read the note. The same PDF also contains the answers.

## Notebooks

These are the coding assignments and can be found in the Notebooks section. There you will find 2 folders 'Bayesian Networks' and 'Variable Elimination'. These corrrespond to 2 separate assignments with the second one being optional but very cool. Keep in mind for the Bayesina Network assignment the students will also need the data and images folder found in the directory. For both assignments we have a student version and a solutions notebook.

Our Jupyter assignments gives student hands-on experience in creating Bayes Net structures, and implementing various related algorithms from scratch.
In experience with industry-standard Bayes Net python package Pomegranate.

Students will be assigned to fill in missing code, write algorithms from scratch, as well as, make observations on the outputs of the code.

The jupyter note book coding assignment require the following packages downloaded.
- numpy
- pandas
- pomegranate
- pygraphviz
- graphviz
- time
- networkx
- sklearn
